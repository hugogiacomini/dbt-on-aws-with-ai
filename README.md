# Football Analytics with AI Agents

An end-to-end data analytics application for football (soccer) data, powered by AI agents.

## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics pipeline that extracts football data from the Football-Data.org API, transforms it using dbt, orchestrates workflows with Apache Airflow, and visualizes insights in Metabase. What makes it unique is that **AI agents** (powered by CrewAI) act as team members—planning, reviewing, and improving the implementation.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Data Extraction**: Python-based ETL from Football-Data.org API
- **Data Transformation**: dbt models for staging and analytics layers
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Apache Airflow DAGs for scheduling and monitoring
- **Data Visualization**: Metabase dashboards for business intelligence
- **AI Agent Team**: CrewAI agents acting as BI Analyst, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Lead Engineer
- **Docker-Based**: Easy local development with Docker Compose
- **Cloud-Ready**: Architecture designed for AWS, GCP, or Azure deployment

**Data Flow:**

1. Extract data from Football-Data.org API (competitions, teams, matches, standings)
2. Load raw data into PostgreSQL (raw schema)
3. Transform with dbt (staging → analytics)
4. Visualize in Metabase
5. Orchestrate with Airflow (daily schedule)
6. AI agents review and suggest improvements

## 📊 Available Analytics

- **Team Performance**: Win rates, goals, points across competitions
- **Match Results**: Detailed match statistics with enriched data
- **Competition Summary**: League-level metrics and trends
- **Head-to-Head**: Historical matchup statistics between teams

## 🤖 AI Agent Team

The project includes four AI agents that collaborate on the project:

1. **Business Intelligence Analyst**
   - Identifies key business questions and KPIs
   - Plans dashboards and visualizations
   - Expert in football industry metrics

2. **Data Analyst**
   - Reviews and designs dbt models
   - Identifies patterns and trends
   - Expert in SQL and data modeling

3. **Data Engineer**
   - Reviews ETL pipelines and data quality
   - Ensures robust error handling
   - Expert in Python, APIs, and Airflow

4. **Lead Data Engineer**
   - Translates business requirements to technical specs
   - Coordinates team and ensures best practices
   - Provides architectural guidance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Football-Data.org API key ([get one here](https://www.football-data.org/))
- (Optional) OpenAI API key for CrewAI agents

### Setup

1. **Clone and configure**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your FOOTBALL_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Start services**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify setup**:

   ```bash
   python3 verify_setup.py
   ```

4. **Access UIs**:
   - Airflow: <http://localhost:8080> (admin/admin)
   - Metabase: <http://localhost:3000>

5. **Trigger ETL pipeline**:
   - Go to Airflow UI
   - Enable `football_etl_pipeline` DAG
   - Click "Trigger DAG"

- **AWS**: RDS (PostgreSQL), MWAA (Airflow), ECS (Metabase)
- **GCP**: Cloud SQL, Cloud Composer, Cloud Run
- **Azure**: Azure Database, Azure Data Factory, Container Instances

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for deployment details.

## 📊 Sample Dashboards

Once data is loaded, create these dashboards in Metabase:

1. **Competition Overview**: Key metrics across all leagues
2. **Team Performance**: Win rates, goals, points by team
3. **Match Analysis**: Goals, trends, home vs away performance
4. **Head-to-Head**: Historical matchup statistics

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for sample queries.

## 🔧 Maintenance

```bash
# Update data (runs automatically daily at 6 AM UTC)
# Or trigger manually in Airflow UI

# Backup database
docker exec football_postgres pg_dump -U airflow football_analytics > backup.sql

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service_name]

# Restart services
docker-compose restart [service_name]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for detailed troubleshooting steps.

Common issues:

- API rate limits: Free tier has 10 requests/minute
- Service won't start: Check Docker logs
- dbt errors: Run `dbt debug --profiles-dir .`
